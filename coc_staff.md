# Internal version for workshop staff

This version is intended for internal use by the workshop staff. It
defines an example enforcement policy that can be tweaked to suit your
workshop organization style.

## Warnings

Any member of workshop staff can issue a verbal warning to a
participant that their behavior violates the workshop's
anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to Marty or Joshua as soon as practical. The report
should include:
-   Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
-   The time you issued the warning
-   The behavior that was in violation
-   The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time
    of warning)
-   The circumstances surrounding the incident
-   Your identity
-   Other people involved in the incident


## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should
record what they say and reassure them they are being taken
seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the
organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter
has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure
them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks
important details such as the identity of the person taking the
harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to
the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange
for an escort by workshop staff or a trusted person, contact a
friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the
reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect
the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with
others, especially individuals who were not involved with the
situation or non-staff members.


## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above
listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However,
here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be
expelled:

* A second offense resulting in a warning from staff
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt
photos)

Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when
    appropriate.


## Public statements

As a general rule, workshop staff should not make any public
statements about the behavior of individual people during or after
the workshop.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act
when necessary.
